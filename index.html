    <p>Nipah Virus (NiV) infection is a newly emerging zoonosis that causes severe disease in both animals and humans. The natural host of the virus are fruit bats of the pteropodidae family, pteropus genus. NiV was first identified during an outbreak of disease that took place in kampung sungai nipah, Malaysia in 1998. On this occasion, pigs were the intermediate hosts. However, in subsequent niv outbreaks, there were no intermediate hosts. In Bangladesh in 2004, humans became infected with NiV as a result of consuming date palm sap that had been contaminated by infected fruit bats. Human-to-human transmission has also been documented, including in a hospital setting in india.</p>

        <p>Hepatitis is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis a virus. The virus is primarily spread when an uninfected (and unvaccinated) person ingests food or water that is contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. The disease is closely associated with unsafe water or food, inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis a infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is often fatal.</p>
